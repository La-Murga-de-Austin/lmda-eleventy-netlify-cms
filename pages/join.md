We're always growing our band with people who want to:

- Play brass or drums at all skill levels
- Lead chants as capos
- Wave flags and hold banners during performances
- Write and suggest songs and chants
- La Murga de Austin's current instrumentation includes Drums (Bombo, Snare, Surdo, Repique) and Brass (Trumpet, Trombone, Baritone/Euphonium). In addition, our members utilize Megaphones, Banderas (Flags), Voice, Coordinated Movement, ASL and other Hand Signals, Smoke Grenades, Festive Attire and Non-Harmful Liquid Projectiles to create our one-of-a-kind Carnaval-like atmosphere.
