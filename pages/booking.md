## Book La Murga for your event

If you would like to book La Murga de Austin to bring the verdinegro carnaval to your event, please email: [info@lamurgadeaustin.org](mailto:info@lamurgadeaustin.org).

Please include:

- Date, time, and duration of the performance(s) requested.
- Perks for performers (ex: free food/drink, reserved parking, swag, etc).
- Your ability to provide a suggested donation to La Murga de Austin for the performance.
- Any other logistical information that will help us decide whether the event is a good fit.

We are an all-volunteer band and we rely on donations for our instruments, travel, and other expenses.
