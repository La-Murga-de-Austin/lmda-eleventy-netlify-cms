## Lyrics

I wanna love ya,
And treat you right.
I wanna love ya,
Everyday and every night.
We'll sing together,
With the roof right over our head.
We'll share the shelter,
Of McKalla End.

Is this love,
Is this love,
Is this love,
Is this love,
That I'm feeling?

Is this love,
Is this love,
Is this love,
Is this love,
That I'm feeling?
