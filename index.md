## La Murga de Austin is the supporters section band for Austin FC.

We are soccer supporters and musicians of all skill levels. Our goal is to help Austin FC win on the field with excitement and style through our songs and chants. We perform locally at parades, festivals, and other events to bring community pride and f√∫tbol culture together.
